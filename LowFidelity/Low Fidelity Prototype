For the evaluation of our low fidelity prototype, we used the Wizard of Oz method, in which a user interacts with an interface manned by a human who controls the system responses.

Five users were asked to test our prototype and here are some quotes we found relevant for our project's development:

"I think these buttons are not very efficient, because I always have to go back to the home menu in order to select another possibility. I'd prefer something like Instagram's design." 

"I would personally like to also have a different view over the budget... something with all the expenses together." 

"The motivational quotes are cute, but I think I wouldn't visit that page much. Maybe they would be more helpful if they spontaneosly appeared on the screen in different pages" 

Conclusion: Most insights were related to the way information was displayed. Therefore, we improved the buttons, added graphics (visual representation of data) and reorganization part of the content on the screen (making it more clear and readable).
