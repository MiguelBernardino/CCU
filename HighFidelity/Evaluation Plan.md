# Evaluation Plan

With this final prototype our objective is to create an easy-to-understand app where the users can easily understand how to manage their finances and are attracted to use it. To achieve this, we will upgrade our existing prototype by passing it from mid fidelity to final, which will implies giving it color, fixing on a few problems that our previous testers found and fix the problems that our testers will eventually find in the first iteration of the final prototype.

We want to demonstrate that the users can perform all sort of tasks in our prototype without problems. We will perform the tests in the street, users’ workplaces and through zoom calls for people that are working in other countries.

The tests will take place between 23 December 2022 and 2 January 2023. Each test will take around 25 minutes:
 - 5 minutes for the intro, where we explain to the tester the rules of the testing process.
 - 10 minutes for tasks for the user.
 - 5 minutes for the tester to freely use the app as he wants.
 - 5 minutes for questions related to the prototype.

For the tests we will need a device (computer, cell phone, etc...) for the user to test our project that is on figma, we will also need to have a recording device to record what the user does and what he says, so we don’t forget or miss any important information. We will use the camera of the phone to record all the information of the interview.

To get users that will test our prototype we will ask random people in the street, we will also try to find testers through social networks, such as linkedin, we will ask people we know that are from our target group to publicize our prototype, so that more people try it. Our target users will be young adults that are starting a new job. We will attempt to get the most diverse group of people so we can understand every group better and make sure that the prototype functions for every person and not only a specific group.

For the final prototypes we are looking to achieve 12 testers for each prototype, this will be enough users, because anymore and the responses will always be the same and the data will be saturated.

Before the deadline we will try to make as much user tests and prototypes as possible to achieve the best prototype for the best experience for all users. This will take some time, but our team is prepared to deal with all the time that will be needed to complete this task. We will also give early access to our application for the testers as our way to say thank you for the help.

The tasks that we will ask our testers to perform are:
 - Connect your bank account to the app
 - Check your notifications
 - Update your profile information
 - Create a new goal
 - Check your average monthly savings
 - Check your budget
 - Add a new fixed expense
 - Share some of your expenses with another user
 - Search information about investments
 - Create a new question

The objective of this tasks will be to understand if the prototype is intuitive and engaging, we also want to know if the users like the color pattern that we choose. We will go through all the data that we received and try to discover patterns that need to be fixed, so we can, in the next iteration, have a better prototype until the point where we are satisfied and ready to present it.

We will divide our users in two groups, one group will be of users who recently moved to a new city or country and the other users who haven’t recently moved, we will be doing this as the first group will have more questions as they will test parts of our prototype that doesn’t make sense for the second group to test.

Our goal is to have a prototype where the users won’t be confused when navigating it and are engaged with it, because our objective is to help them get better financially and this will only happen if the users have fun using the app and don’t find it as a chore.
