# High fidelity prototypes

For the evaluation of our high fidelity prototypes, made in figma, we asked users to do sets of tasks and recorded how much time they took to make them. We also asked them to think aloud in order for us to get a better insight of what to change and improve. In the end we also asked what the users thought of the app.

The set of tasks was:
 - Connect your bank account to the app
 - Check your notifications
 - Update your profile information
 - Create a new goal
 - Check your average monthly savings
 - Check your budget
 - Add a new fixed expense
 - Share some of your expenses with another user
 - Search information about investments
 - Create a new question

#### First Iteration Conclusions

For the final prototype we achieved a total of  12 testers these were enough since we got very positive and diverse feedback such as:

“The “share budget” interface is really intuitive. I would for sure use it to split the budget and expenses with my friends on our next trip.”

“I really loved the motivational quotes! It was a very small but caring detail that made me feel more comfortable with the app.”

"It's good to see the overview over all the expenses and considering the income in the budget menu. It really gives a much clear perspective about how our money is organized and how much we might be able to save.“

Conclusion: The users were really happy with the app we gave them to test!
