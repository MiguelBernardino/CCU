# High fidelity prototypes

For the evaluation of our high fidelity prototypes, made in figma, we asked users to do sets of tasks and recorded how much time they took to make them. We also asked them to think aloud in order for us to get a better insight of what to change and improve. In the end we also asked what the users thought of the app.

The set of tasks was:
 - Connect your bank account to the app
 - Check your notifications
 - Update your profile information
 - Create a new goal
 - Check your average monthly savings
 - Check your budget
 - Add a new fixed expense
 - Share some of your expenses with another user
 - Search information about investments
 - Create a new question

#### Results

The results to this iteration transcended everything we could hope for it, so we didn't need to create another.
