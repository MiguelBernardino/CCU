### Scenario 1: Alex

Alex, 23, a software engineer at Deloitte who is not financially literate and for this reason ends up spending money on unnecessary things, needs to save his money efficiently while he’s living in his parents’ house, so he can save money and move.

Although he has goals, such as buying his own house, he often can’t save money at the end of every month due to his monetary disorganisation. He usually doesn't know where he is spending his salary, because he doesn’t control and check his transactions. He also enjoys fashion clothes and he buys every time he wants without checking if there will be some sales/promotions in the next few days.

He would like to find something to help him save part of his salary every month in order to buy his own house and also to learn more about finances and saving strategies.
