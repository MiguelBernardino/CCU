# Mid fidelity prototypes

For the evaluation of our mid fidelity prototypes, made in figma, we asked users to do sets of tasks and recorded how much time they took to make them. We also asked them to think aloud in order for us to get a better insight of what to change and improve.

The set of tasks was:
 - How much more money do you have to save until you reach your goal
 - Add a new budget to cloathing expenses
 - In which month did you save the most?
 - How many answers does your question #1 already have?

#### First Iteration Conclusions

Five users were asked to test our prototype and here are some quotes we found relevant for our project's development:

“I think these buttons are not very efficient, because I always have to go back to the home menu in order to select another possibility. I’d prefer something like Instagram’s design.”

“I would personally like to also have a different view over the budget... something with all the expenses together.”

“The motivational quotes are cute, but I think I wouldn’t visit that page much. Maybe they would be more helpful if they spontaneosly appeared on the screen in different pages” 

Conclusion: Most insights by our testers were related to the way information was displayed therefore we improved the buttons and added graphics in order to better visually represent our data

#### Second Iteration Conclusions

Five users were asked to test our prototype and here are some quotes we found relevant for our project's development:

“There are probably some new categories in budget that I would also like to personalise.” 

“It would be cool to also visualize the income and outcome associated to the balance showed in the home page.”

“Where could I connect this app with my bank account?”

Conclusion: Our idea is strong enough to pass to the high fidelity.
