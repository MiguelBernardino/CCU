# Mid fidelity prototypes

For the evaluation of our mid fidelity prototypes, made in figma, we asked users to do sets of tasks and recorded how much time they took to make them. We also asked them to think aloud in order for us to get a better insight of what to change and improve.

The set of tasks was:
 - How much more money do you have to save until you reach your goal
 - Add a new budget to cloathing expenses
 - In which month did you save the most?
 - How many answers does your question #1 already have?
